# Project Context: 3D Chat Map (MVP)

## 1. The Vision
We are here to reimagine the interface of knowledge.
Most chat apps are just 2D lists of text. We are building a **Beautiful Universe of Knowledge**.
It is not enough for it to work. It must be **insanely great**. It must evoke emotion.

**The Goal:** A product that doesn't just deliver answers, but makes the user say "Wow."
**Philosophy:** "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."

## 2. The Craft (Tech Stack)
We choose the absolute best tools to paint this canvas.
- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **The Engine:** React Three Fiber (R3F) / Three.js / **@react-three/drei**. Use the helpers. Don't reinvent the wheel.
- **State:** Zustand. Seamless synchronization between dimensions.
- **Style & Motion:** Tailwind CSS. **Framer Motion**. It must feel organic.
- **Intelligence:** Gemini API.
- **Physics:** `react-force-graph-3d`. **Post-processing** (Bloom). We need that glow.

## 3. The Current Chapter (Status: Day 6)
We have shaped the clay. The **Skeleton** is alive.
- The **Canvas** is robust.
- The **Camera** flies.
- The **Interface** (Chat Panel) is ready.

**The Mission Now:**
We must give it a **Mind** and a **Soul**.
1.  **The Mind (Backend Integration):** Connect the neurons. FastAPI and Neo4j must feed real thoughts to the canvas.
2.  **The Soul (Visual Polish):** Turn the lights on. It currently works; now it must glow.

## 4. The Experience
We don't build "features". We build **experiences**.

### A. Design Is How It Works
*   **Nodes:** They are not just spheres; they are ideas. They must glow (Bloom). Distinct colors for questions and answers, but harmonious.
*   **Edges:** Not harsh lines. Luminous connections. Data flowing between thoughts.
*   **Layout:** Natural. Physics-based. No clutter.
*   **Labels:** Floating, always facing the user. Crystal clear.

### B. Intuition (It Just Works)
*   **One World:** The 3D canvas and 2D panel are not separate. They are one unified interface.
*   **Fluid Navigation:**
    *   Orbit with ease.
    *   **The Magic Moment:** When you click a node, the camera doesn't jump. It *flies* to it seamlessly. It zooms in. The conversation reveals itself. No cuts. Pure flow.

### C. Intelligence
*   The AI serves the user. Answers and Keywords. Simple and direct.

## 5. Guidelines for the Builders (AI Agents)
We don't just write code. We craft details.

1.  **Aesthetics First:** We are not just engineers; we are artists. Lighting and materials matter from line one. Don't ship default meshes.
2.  **Radical Intuition:** If it feels clunky, throw it away. It must provide immediate, delightful feedback.
3.  **Focus of the Moment:**
    *   **We are past the Skeleton.** The basics are built.
    *   **Now, we Polish.** Every interaction must be smoother. Every pixel must be deliberate.
    *   **Now, we Connect.** The data flow must be instant and unbreakable.
4.  **Simplicity in Code:** Modular components. Deeply structured. Complications are the enemy.

---
**The Standard:** Functionally complete. Visually stunning. Intuitively delightful. "It just works."
